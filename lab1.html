        <h2>Lab 1 - Artemis:</h2>
        <p>In this lab I set up and familiarized myself with the Artemis board and Arduino IDE. I was able to program my board, blink the internal LED, read/write serial messages over USB, display the output from the onboard temperature sensor, and measure the loudest frequency recorded by a Pulse Density Microphone.</p>
        <h3>Step 1:</h3>
        <p>I already had the Arduino IDE installed from previous projects including ECE 3400.</p>

        <h3>Step 2:</h3>
        <p>I followed the instructions and set up the Artemis Board without any issues.</p>

        <h3>Step 3:</h3>
        <p>The “Example: Blink it Up” sketch successfully uploaded and yielded the following result:</p>

          </video>
        <h3>Step 4:</h3>

        <p>At first the Serial example sketch uploaded but printed gibberish, so I changed the baud rate of the Serial Monitor to match that of the Serial.begin statement. After that the sketch successfully uploaded and yielded the following sensible Serial
            output:

        </video>

        <h3>Step 5:</h3>
        <p>The analog read example sketch immediately ran and outputted correctly, but I had trouble getting the temp output to change significantly by blowing on it. I eventually was able to get meaningful results by taking the Artemis outside into 30 degree
            weather and then returning to my heated apartment. That yielded the following Serial output:</p>

        </video>

        <h3>Step 6:</h3>
        <p>The microphone output example uploaded successfully and outputted meaningful, interesting results on the first try. The following is the Serial output from me whistling into the Artemis while it was running this sketch:</p>
